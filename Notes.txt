* Better to write the namespace with :: as we may not use single namespace throughout a program. 
*  Overflow: 
    char x = 127;
    std::cout << (int)x << std::endl; // prints 127
    x++;
    std::cout << (int)x << std::endl; // prints -128

* Dynamic decleration of variables allows you to use variables wherever they needed. 
    This improves efficiency as the declared variable will be removed after its scope ends. 
    You can define a variable inside an if statement, just like you do in for loops. 

* In switch case statement, a fall-thru means executing next case in the absence of a break.
